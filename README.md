# Fitness_Tracker
Fitness Tracker using MongoDB/Mongoose as back-end database


## Installation:
This project requires installation of npm express and npm mongoose. 

## Usage:
Use this app to store and retrieve workout data. Input new workouts, edit workouts, and view aggregated data about the last 7 workouts. 

## Contributing:
This project is open to contributions.

## To Do:
* There may be some nested objects in the get route on the index view of the last workout.
* Look into the id in the url.
* Change to last 7 days vs. last 7 workouts? Last 7 workouts seemed to mirror dev instructions, but last 7 days might make more sense in real-life use and might render cleaner.
